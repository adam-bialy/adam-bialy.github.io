      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I have a lifelong passion for science and the natural world. I am a curious person who enjoys learning new things,
        investigating scientific problems and synthesizing my findings into words and images.
        I also find great satisfaction in coding and in the creative process of software development.
        Throughout my career, I have worked in academia, public educational institutions, software houses,
        and pharmaceutical companies. I am fluent in Polish (my native language), English and Spanish.
        In the following sections, you can find a more detailed description of my professional experience.</p>
      <p>
        I am always looking for new challenges and interesting projects.

        <h2>Chemical research</h2>
        <img src="icons/periodic-table.png" alt="" class="skill-image left">
        <p>I have been involved with chemistry as a subject of study and research for 15 years.
          In 2018 I obtained a <span class="bold">PhD degree in chemical sciences</span> at
          University of Warsaw. My work has been focused on compounds of silver and their potential
          application as novel high-temperature superconductors. As part of Prof. Wojciech Grochala's
          team at University of Warsaw's Center of New Technologies, I have approached this topic
          from a variety of angles, including photoelecton spectroscopy, high-pressure crystallography
          and—in recent years—computational modelling of new hypothetical silver- and hydride-based materials.
          As of <span id="dateA"></span>, I have written or contributed to <span class="bold">18 scientific papers</span>,
          a complete list of which can be found on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UFotHJsAAAAJ" target="_blank">Google Scholar.</a>
          <br><u>My personal highlights</u>: our visionary 2020 <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.4.084405" target="_blank">paper</a>
          in <em>Physical Review Materials</em> (distinguished as Editor's Choice by the journal) and a 2021
          <a href=" https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202103886" target="_blank">follow-up</a> in <em>Angewandte Chemie</em>, describing
          the <span class="bold">chemical capacitor</span>: a proposed new type of functional material.

      <div class="skill-div" id="coding">
        <h2>Software development</h2>
        <img src="icons/binary-code.png" alt="" class="skill-image right">
        <p>During my academic career, I also developed a set of programming skills, which initially served me
          mostly as a tool for analysis of output data from quantum-mechanical calculations. However, in recent years
          I have found increasing satisfaction in the creative process of coding itself, and decided to transition
          to programming as a full-time job. I currently work as a Python developer at
          <a href="https://www.polcode.com/" target="_blank">Polcode</a>, where I implement backend solutions for the company's customers.
          Still, as a scientist at heart, I continue to educate myself in my spare time in the areas of data science
          and machine learning.
          <br><u>Most important tools I am familiar with (in no particular order):</u>
          Django, Django REST Framework, FastAPI, Flask, pytest, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, Tensorflow,
          matplotlib, PostgreSQL, Docker, Docker Compose, AWS Lambda, Serverless, JavaScript.
          <br>A few examples of projects which I developed in my spare time can be found on my
          <a href="https://github.com/adam-bialy" target="_blank">GitHub profile</a>.

        <h2>Science communication</h2>
        <img src="icons/science.png" alt="" class="skill-image left">
        <p>Throughout my professional life, I have had many opportunities to discuss science with diverse groups of people
          and using different means of communication. I worked as an explainer at Copernicus Science Center in Warsaw,
          where I would engage in conversations with visitors in order to enhance their experience and explain scientific topics
          to them in an accessible manner. I have written many scientific articles for specialized journals and
          delivered talks at international conferences. As part of my PhD studies, I taught and assisted undergraduate students
          in laboratory classes. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I worked at Pfizer as a medical information consultant,
          responding to queries made by healthcare professionals and patients.<br>

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>In my spare time, I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee, travelling, learning about geography, astronomy and history, and photography.
