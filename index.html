      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I have a lifelong passion for science and curiosity of the natural world. I enjoy learning new things, investigating scientific problems,
        and synthesizing my findings into words and images. Throughout my career, I have worked in academia, public educational institutions
        and in multinational companies. I am fluent in Polish (my native language), English and Spanish. In the sections below, you can find a more detailed description of my professional experience.</p>
      <p>

        <h2>Chemical research</h2>
        <img src="icons/periodic-table.png" alt="" class="skill-image left">
        <p>I have been involved with chemistry as a topic of study and research for 15 years. In 2018 I obtained a <span class="bold">PhD degree in chemical sciences</span> at
          University of Warsaw. My work has been focused on compounds of silver and their potential application as novel high-temperature superconductors.
          As part of Prof. Wojciech Grochala's team at University of Warsaw's Center of New Technologies, I have approached this area from a variety of angles,
          including photoelecton spectroscopy, high-pressure crystallography and—in recent years—computational modelling of new hypothetical
          silver and hydride-based materials. As of April 2022, I have written or contributed to <span class="bold">18 scientific papers</span>, a complete list of which can be found on
          <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UFotHJsAAAAJ" target="_blank">Google Scholar.</a><br>
          <u>My personal highlight</u>: our visionary 2020
          <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.4.084405" target="_blank">paper</a>
          in <em>Physical Review Materials</em>, which was distinguished as Editor's Choice by the journal.

        <h2>Programming</h2>
        <img src="icons/binary-code.png" alt="" class="skill-image right">
        <p>In parallel to my research career, I have pursued coding both as a tool for data analysis in my scientific work, and as a hobby.
          I have a working knowledge of <span class="bold">Python</span>, including data science libraries such as <span class="code">numpy</span>, <span class="code">pandas</span>
          and <span class="code">matplotlib</span>. I am also interested in machine learning and neural networks. I am familiar with principles
          of statistical learning methods and deep learning, and with corresponding tools implemented in Python (<span class="code">scikit-learn</span> and
          <span class="code">tensorflow</span>) and <span class="bold">R</span>. Other programming skills in my toolkit include front-end development with <span class="bold">
            HTML/CSS/Javascript</span>, and basic knowledge of <span class="bold">SQL</span> and <span class="bold">C#</span>.
          My coding projects can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/adam-bialy" target="_blank">GitHub profile</a>.

        <h2>Science communication</h2>
        <img src="icons/science.png" alt="" class="skill-image left">
        <p>Throughout my professional life, I have had many opportunities to discuss science with diverse groups of people and using different means of communication.
          I worked as an explainer at Copernicus Science Center in Warsaw, where I would engage in conversations with visitors in order to enhance their experience and
          explain scientific topics to them in an accessible manner. I have written many scientific articles for specialized journals and delivered talks at international
          conferences. During my PhD studies, I taught and assisted students in laboratory classes. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I worked at Pfizer as a medical information
          consultant, responding to queries made by healthcare professionals and patients.<br>

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>In my spare time, I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee, learning about geography, astronomy and history, travelling, and photography.
